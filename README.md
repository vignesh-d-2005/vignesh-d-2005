## 🚀 Quick Snapshot
- 🔭 Currently exploring: **UI/UX design**, **graphical design**, and hands-on AI tools.  
- 🌱 Learning: Advanced design systems, Figma micro-interactions, motion design, and ML-assisted design workflows.  
- 💬 Ask me about: front-end UI prototypes, design to code workflows, or AI tooling for designers.  
- 📫 Reach me: add contact details or link (email/LinkedIn) in your repo later.

## 🧭 Skills & Tools
- **Design:** Figma, Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop  
- **Frontend / Prototyping:** HTML/CSS, React basics, Tailwind (learning)  
- **AI / ML Tools:** Prompt engineering, exploring tools that assist designers (Play.ht, Runway, Midjourney-style workflows)  
- **Other:** Git, VS Code, basic data structures & algorithms (4th-year CSE)

## ✨ Projects / Playground
> _Keep this section updated with links to your projects._  
- **Portfolio Mockups** — interactive prototypes and design system docs.  
- **AI Design Experiments** — small demos using prompts + CSS/SVG auto-generation.  
- **Course Projects** — compiler or systems projects from coursework (link to repos).

---

## 🎯 Readme Features (what's going on)
- Animated header is a **pure SVG** (`assets/header.svg`) — fast, lightweight, and renders in GitHub.
- The design uses gradients, particle motion, and subtle SMIL/CSS animations to create a futuristic look.
- You can customize colors, fonts, and text directly in `assets/header.svg`.

---

## 🛠 How to customize the header
1. Open `assets/header.svg` in any text editor.  
2. Edit the big text (`Vignesh Vicky`) or subtitle lines directly.  
3. Adjust colors in the `<linearGradient>` blocks (`#g1`, `#g2`) to match your brand.  
4. Save and push to GitHub — the README will render the animated SVG automatically.

## 👣 Next steps (suggested)
- Add links to your portfolio or Dribbble/Behance.  
- Replace the placeholder project list with real repo links.  
- Add a "Design Tokens" section linking to a design-system file.  
- Add a GIF or short MP4 demo inside `/assets` and link it from README for richer motion demos.

If you want, tell me where to link your email / LinkedIn / Instagram and I’ll update the contact snippet in the README.

> _If you want, I can also produce a dark-mode variant, export a PNG fallback for places that don't support inline SVG animation, or generate a version that embeds your avatar and a short animated timeline of your studies/projects — tell me which and I'll include it directly in the repo code._
